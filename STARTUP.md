   - Download from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

2. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   cd E:\mudi-mental-health-companion
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access your app**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000
   - API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Option 2: Manual Setup (Without Docker)

#### Backend Setup:
```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd E:\mudi-mental-health-companion\backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

#### Frontend Setup:
```bash
# Open new terminal and navigate to frontend
cd E:\mudi-mental-health-companion\frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the frontend
npm run dev
```

## 🔑 Optional API Keys

Your app works perfectly without API keys, but you can enhance it by adding:

### OpenAI API Key (for better AI chat responses):
1. Get API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Edit `.env` file and uncomment:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

### Spotify API (for real playlist generation):
1. Create app at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
2. Edit `.env` file and uncomment:
   ```
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   ```
